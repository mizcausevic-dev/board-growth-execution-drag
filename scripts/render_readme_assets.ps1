  "This view keeps revenue, identity, biotech, and FinTech lanes tied to the precise blocker patterns that are slowing real delivery.",
  "Thin blocker proof remains visible before it turns into another memo or investor narrative that outruns actual operating motion.",

  "The intervention-posture view keeps the next board move attached to actual execution friction instead of abstract timing stories.",
  "Weak visibility remains visible before the board assumes the upside is already durable.",
  "This creates a repeatable packet that can travel into board, diligence, and operating reviews."
